Bioinformatic pipeline followed to do haplotype calling of Oophaga granulifera RNA reads when using the reference genome of Oophaga sylvatica

Main steps included:
1- RNA reads quality trimming
2- Generation of genome index
3- Mapping reads against reference using STAR
4- Mark duplicates
5- Merge tissues per individuals
6- Fix groups ID
7- SplitNCigar 
8- GATK Haplotype Calling
9- GATK Merge individuals
10- VCF postprocessing


For each step I provide the used script. Note that all bioinformatic analyses were conducted in a remote server of HPC from the Emmy/Grete at NHR–Nord@Göttingen.
